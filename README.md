__Product Studio Fall '19__

Our project for fall semester product studio at Cornell Tech.

Rooted in our frustration of scrubbing through hours of lecture videos to find that one section of Knapsack Algorithm you need to watch,
we created Lexture to automatically transcribe, index and tag lecture content to make revising a (slightly) less painful task.
